-------------------- Design Changes 2  (08/05/2021) ----------------

The device will no longer have a back-up battery supply. The power will be provided entirely by USB.

To prevent video corruption at power loss, a supercapacitor will be added to keep the device awake until it can perform a safe switch off.

The reason for these changes are as follows:

1. Most dashcams on the market require being plugged in to power for use. Their batteries do not last long. So customers are used to 
plugging their dash-cams to power anyway.
2. NiMH batteries do not do well in high temperatures, and it is too risky to have them in a car i.e. in the summer, without doing extensive 
testing which would delay the project completion too much.
3. Li-Ion batteries can handle high temperatures, but they are too risky to charge and may cause concern for customers.
4. Battery placement and size was causing issues. I.e. where to put them; front has camera, back has OLED.
